;;;; tests/integration/sicp-canonical-solutions.lisp --- One DB-backed
;;;; integration test that asserts every canonical SICP solution under
;;;; docs/sicp/*.md grades as :PASS against its sibling exercise.
;;;;
;;;; This replaces the per-notebook tests/game/notebooks/sicp-*.lisp
;;;; suite (one file per chapter section) that existed before the
;;;; module-based notebook registry was retired in favour of DB-backed
;;;; user-notebooks under the SICP course. The single deftest below
;;;; iterates over every (exercise, solution) pair in every SICP
;;;; markdown fixture and runs the exercise cell with the canonical
;;;; solution body injected, asserting the cell result status is :PASS.
