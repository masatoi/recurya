;;;; tests/integration/sicp-seed.lisp --- Integration tests for the
;;;; generic official-content seeder (recurya/seed/official-content).
;;;;
;;;; SICP is the first registry entry. These tests cover:
;;;;   * natural-string< ordering (non-DB)
;;;;   * drift guard between the SICP spec and the wardlisp redirect (non-DB)
;;;;   * SICP author/course seeding + idempotency (DB)
;;;;   * generic notebook attachment + natural ordering via fixtures (DB)
;;;;
;;;; The SICP author uses an @example.invalid email which is NOT swept by
;;;; cleanup-all-test-data (only @example.com); DB tests delete it in an
;;;; unwind-protect. The generic fixture author uses @example.com so it is
;;;; cleaned automatically. with-test-db wipes all course/notebook rows.
