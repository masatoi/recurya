;;;; tests/web/dashboard-auth.lisp --- Tests for the require-dashboard-auth
;;;; Lack middleware.
;;;;
;;;; Covers:
;;;;   * Anonymous requests to /dashboard and /dashboard/* are redirected
;;;;     to /login.
;;;;   * Public paths (e.g. /notebooks, /, /login) are NOT redirected.
;;;;   * Authenticated requests pass through to the wrapped app.
;;;;   * Composition with require-real-handle: an authenticated user with a
;;;;     placeholder handle hits the login gate (pass through), then is
;;;;     redirected to /onboarding/handle by the next middleware in the chain.
