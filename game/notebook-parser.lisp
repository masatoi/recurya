   BODY-MD is a string using `===KIND===' fence lines to delimit cells.
   Supported fences:
     ===prose===
     ===eval===
     ===exercise: <description>===
     ===expect===
     ===expect: <description>===

   Each parsed cell receives a string UUID as its ID, unless a cell in
   EXISTING-CELLS matches by (KIND BODY DESCRIPTION) — in that case the
   existing cell's ID is reused so that learner progress (keyed by
   cell-id) survives notebook edits. Matching is first-fit and
   consume-on-match: each existing cell can be reused at most once.

   ERRORS is a list of plists (:line N :message \"...\") where N is the
   1-based line number of the offending input. The following validation
   errors are emitted:

     * `===expect===' or `===expect: <desc>===' with no preceding
       `===exercise===' cell.
     * Bare `===exercise===' header without a description.
     * Unknown fence header (anything that looks like `===...===' but
       does not match a recognised kind).
     * The body contains no cell at all (empty/whitespace-only input,
       or input consisting only of unknown / stray headers).

   State machine:
     * CURRENT-KIND / CURRENT-DESC / CURRENT-BUFFER hold the cell that is
       currently being collected (prose, eval, or exercise body).
     * PENDING-EXERCISE-CELL is non-NIL while collecting test-cases for
       an exercise. When the exercise body is closed (by encountering an
       :expect header), the cell struct is constructed and held here so
       successive ===expect=== blocks can append test-cases.
     * IN-EXPECT-P + EXPECT-DESC + EXPECT-BUFFER track the currently
       collected expect block, finalised on the next non-expect header
       or EOF.

   Test-cases accumulate on PENDING-EXERCISE-CELL via APPEND so they are
   stored in source order. The exercise cell is flushed to CELLS only
   when the next non-expect header arrives (or EOF)."
