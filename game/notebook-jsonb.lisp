;;;; game/notebook-jsonb.lisp --- Cell <-> JSONB hash-table conversion.
;;;;
;;;; Pure conversion between notebook cell structs and the hash-table
;;;; shape stored in the notebook.cells JSONB column. Lives at the game
;;;; layer (no web dependency) so both web/routes and the official-content
;;;; seeder can share it.
